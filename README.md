The file name **needs** to be `[number]_[date].md`.\
The number is for ordering the blog posts (biggest number means newest post - placed on top).\
The date is added to the blog post as publish date (it should be formatted like: `[day]. [month] [year]`).\
Example: `13_5. December 2023.md` (`13_5. detsember 2023.md` for estonian file).
